To install Flask:
1: Create a virtual environment on your local machine in the vibes directory.
   It's probably not required that you do this in a virtual environment, but generally
   it's good practice to have all the required libraries for a project within
   a virtual environment specific to that project, so your local machine
   doesn't end up with a whole mess of libraries from using pip install
   for a million different projects. 
    a. Run the command: python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
    b. To activate the virtual environment in the GitBash shell, run 
       the command: source <virtual-environment-name>/Scripts/activate.
       I'm not sure how to run it from PowerShell because Windows terminals are weird.

2: Once the environment is installed, and activated, run pip install Flask,
   then run pip list to make sure it installed correctly.

3: Now you need to set the FLASK_APP environment variable so the app can run
   on localhost. To do this, run the command: setx FLASK_APP app.py
   in the Windows terminal in the vibes directory

4: To run the app, use the command: flask run

5: You're all set!
